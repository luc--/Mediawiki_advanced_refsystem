# Mediawiki_advanced_refsystem

When digitalizing a book in wikisource, it often happens that the notes printed in the book aren't as simple as those generated by the medawiki tag `<ref>`. The template provided has no other dependance than the reference system of mediawiki (others can be needed in the documentation still).

## License

This template is provided under the GPLv3 license.

## Installation

Just create a `Template:Note page` in your wiki, and transfer the content of the `Mod√®le:Note.wikimedia` file into it.

## Use

````mediawiki
{{Note|t|id|tr}}
````

All parameters are optionnal. If there is no parameter, nothing is displayed.

If there is only the first parameter (`t`), it works like a normal reference, and if there are the first and the second parameters, it works like a named reference : `<ref name="id">t</ref>`

Finally, if you use a third parameter, it will display this third parameter in the text instead of the number of the reference.
